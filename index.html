            Hello, my name is Josh Hawk. I have been an educator for the past 15 years and I recently decided to forge a new path into the world of tech. In order to jumpstart this career change, I've enrolled in a full stack coding boot camp through Georgia Tech. This portfolio is where I will display the different projects I create throughout the boot camp, as well as some personal projects I do on the side. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments using my contact information. I hope you enjoy, and thanks for stopping by!

Users can register a profile with the website, make posts, reply on existing hosts, and use the search feature to find items by category. I created this app along with three other team members as part of a collaborative group project.
